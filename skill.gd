Godot Skill Component: A Truly Data-Driven Architecture
This document outlines a robust, data-driven architecture for creating skill and status effect systems in Godot. The previous design has been deprecated due to significant scalability and maintenance issues. This new system centralizes all conditional logic and its consequences into a single, readable data source, eliminating code duplication and empowering designers.

The core components are:

PropertyProjector.gd: The unchanged mathematical engine. It takes a base value and applies a series of Modifier objects to calculate a final result. Its role remains the same.

BattleRuleProcessor.gd: The new central logic engine. It replaces the TagBuilder. Instead of just outputting descriptive tags, it reads a rules.json file and directly outputs Modifier objects based on the current game context.

The fundamental shift is this: Skills no longer contain any conditional logic. They simply define their base effect and ask the BattleRuleProcessor to handle all modifications.

Core Concept: Centralized Logic with rules.json
The entire "IF-THEN" logic of your game's interactions is now defined in a single rules.json file. This file dictates not only when a change should happen, but also what that change is.

New rules.json Structure
Each rule now defines a list of modifiers to be created if its conditions are met.

conditions: A dictionary describing the logic. It can check properties from the caster, the target, the skill itself, or the environment.

modifiers: An array of modifier objects to be generated. Each object contains the exact data needed to create a PropertyProjector.Modifier.

Example rules.json:

[
  {
    "id": "frozen_vulnerability",
    "conditions": {
      "and": [
        { "property": "target_status", "op": "eq", "value": "frozen" },
        { "property": "skill_damage_type", "op": "eq", "value": "fire" }
      ]
    },
    "modifiers": [
      {
        "id": "frozen_fire_vulnerability_mod",
        "op": "MUL",
        "value": 2.0,
        "priority": 100,
        "applies_to": []
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "bloodied_rage",
    "conditions": {
        "property": "caster_health_percentage", "op": "lt", "value": 0.25
    },
    "modifiers": [
      {
        "id": "bloodied_rage_mod",
        "op": "ADD",
        "value": 15.0,
        "priority": 5,
        "applies_to": ["physical_damage"]
      }
    ]
  }
]

With this structure, a designer can create a new interaction (e.g., "bloodied characters deal more physical damage") entirely within this JSON file, requiring zero code changes.

The New Workflow: A Decoupled Calculation
The key to avoiding performance overhead and brittle logic is to give entities persistent PropertyProjector instances and use a temporary, combined projector for skill calculations.

1. Persistent Projectors on Entities:
Every character or entity in the game has its own instance(s) of PropertyProjector. For example, a character might have damage_projector, defense_projector, and speed_projector. When a character receives a "Bless" buff, a permanent Modifier is added to their damage_projector.

2. The Skill Execution Flow:
When a skill is used, the following happens:

A temporary calculation_projector is created.

It begins by cloning all modifiers from the caster's relevant projector (e.g., their damage_projector). This ensures all the caster's own buffs are included.

The skill gathers a context dictionary with all relevant information: the caster's state, the target's state, and the skill's own properties (like damage_type).

This context is sent to the global BattleRuleProcessor.

The BattleRuleProcessor evaluates the rules.json against the context and returns an array of all applicable Modifier objects.

These new contextual modifiers are added to the calculation_projector.

Finally, any opposing modifiers from the target (e.g., from their defense_projector) are also added.

The skill's base value is passed to the fully configured calculation_projector's get_projected_value() method to get the final result.

Revised Example Skill Implementation
Note the complete absence of if statements related to game logic. The skill is now simple and declarative.

# --- Hypothetical Skill.gd (REVISED) ---
extends Node

# Reference to the global rule processor
@onready var rule_processor: Node = get_node("/root/RuleProcessor")

var base_damage: float = 50.0
var damage_type: String = "fire"

func execute(caster, target):
    # 1. Create a temporary projector, starting with the caster's own buffs.
    var calculation_projector = caster.damage_projector.clone() # Assume a clone method exists

    # 2. Gather context for the rules engine.
    var context = {
        "caster_health_percentage": caster.get_health_percentage(),
        "target_status": target.get_status(),
        "skill_damage_type": self.damage_type
    }
    
    # 3. Get all contextual modifiers from the BattleRuleProcessor.
    var contextual_modifiers = rule_processor.get_modifiers_for_context(context)
    for mod in contextual_modifiers:
        calculation_projector.add_modifier(mod)
        
    # 4. Add the target's defensive modifiers.
    for mod in target.defense_projector.list_modifiers():
        calculation_projector.add_modifier(mod)

    # 5. Calculate final damage. The skill doesn't know or care *why* the number changes.
    var final_damage = calculation_projector.get_projected_value(base_damage)
    
    # 6. Apply damage.
    print("Fireball hit for %d damage." % final_damage)
    target.take_damage(final_damage)
