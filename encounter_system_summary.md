# Encounter System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The encounter system has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Core Classes Created:
1. **EncounterManager** (`encounter_manager.gd`) - Main orchestrator for encounters
2. **Encounter** (`encounter.gd`) - Individual encounter configuration
3. **Wave** (`wave.gd`) - Wave management within encounters
4. **EncounterRewards** (`encounter_rewards.gd`) - Rewards and progression system
5. **DifficultyScaler** (`difficulty_scaler.gd`) - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
6. **UnitFactory** (`unit_factory.gd`) - Enemy generation from templates

### Data Files Created:
1. **encounters.json** - Contains 5 sample encounters:
   - Tutorial Battle
   - Forest Ambush
   - Goblin Camp (optional)
   - Mountain Pass
   - Abandoned Cemetery (boss)

2. **unit_templates.json** - Contains 12 enemy templates:
   - Bandits (warrior, archer, rogue, leader)
   - Goblins (warrior, shaman)
   - Beasts (wolf, dire wolf)
   - Undead (skeleton warrior/archer, necromancer)

### Features Implemented:
- **Wave Types**: Standard, Boss, Survival, Timed, Endless, Objective
- **Victory Conditions**: Eliminate all, survive time, defeat target, protect ally
- **Difficulty Modes**: Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, Adaptive
- **Dynamic Modifiers**: Environment effects, wave-specific bonuses
- **Rewards System**: XP, gold, items, unlockables, performance bonuses
- **Formation System**: Various enemy formations (line, triangle, circle, etc.)

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Extended `AutoBattler` to support wave context
- Added encounter-specific rules to `battle_rules.json`
- Leverages existing property projection system for modifiers
- Uses existing AI and skill systems

### Test Scene:
- Created `encounter_test.gd` and `encounter_test.tscn` for testing
- Provides UI for selecting encounters and difficulty
- Shows wave progression and rewards

## Usage Example:

```gdscript
# Initialize encounter manager
var encounter_manager = EncounterManager.new()
encounter_manager.difficulty_mode = DifficultyScaler.DifficultyMode.NORMAL

# Start an encounter
var player_team = [warrior, mage, healer, archer]
encounter_manager.start_encounter("forest_ambush", player_team)

# Handle signals
encounter_manager.wave_started.connect(_on_wave_started)
encounter_manager.encounter_completed.connect(_on_encounter_completed)
```

## Next Steps:
1. Create visual effects for wave transitions
2. Add save/load functionality for encounter progress
3. Create encounter selection UI (map/menu)
4. Add more enemy types and encounters
5. Implement achievement system
6. Create encounter editor tool
