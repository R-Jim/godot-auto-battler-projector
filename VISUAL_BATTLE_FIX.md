# Visual Battle Fix

## Changes Made

1. **Modified `src/battle/auto_battler.gd`**:
   - Changed from `extends Node` to `extends Node2D` to support positioning
   - Added `_setup_unit_visual()` function to create visual components for units
   - Added unit positioning logic (team1 on left, team2 on right)
   - Added preload for UnitVisual class

2. **Updated `scenes/tests/progression_test_scene.tscn`**:
   - Changed AutoBattler from Node to Node2D
   - Added Camera2D at position (576, 324)
   - Added BattleBackground ColorRect for visual reference

3. **Created `scenes/tests/visual_battle_test.tscn` and `scenes/tests/visual_battle_test.gd`**:
   - New dedicated test scene for visual battle testing
   - Includes Camera2D, background, and UI elements
   - Creates test units with proper stats
   - Shows battle progress in UI

## How to Test

1. **Visual Battle Test Scene**:
   - Open `scenes/tests/visual_battle_test.tscn` in Godot
   - Press F6 or Run Scene
   - Click "Start Battle" button
   - You should see colored squares representing units positioned on screen
   - Watch the battle progress with visual animations

2. **Progression Test Scene**:
   - Open `scenes/tests/progression_test_scene.tscn` in Godot
   - Press F6 or Run Scene
   - Select an encounter from the list
   - Click "Start Encounter"
   - You should now see the battle units visually on screen

## Visual Components

Each unit now has:
- A colored square sprite (64x64 pixels)
  - Team 1 (players): Cyan color
  - Team 2 (enemies): Orange color
- Health bar above the unit
- Unit name label
- Status effect indicators
- Attack/hurt animations

## Positioning

- Team 1 units: X=100, Y=100 + (index * 120)
- Team 2 units: X=700, Y=100 + (index * 120)
- Camera centered at (576, 324) to view the battlefield

## Troubleshooting

If units still aren't visible:
1. Check Godot's Remote/Scene panel during runtime
2. Verify Camera2D is active
3. Check unit positions in Inspector
4. Ensure z_index is correct (background should be -1)
